# Flutter Starter Template

Welcome to my Flutter Starter Template! This project is a basic setup that includes routing and theming, structured in a way that I find meaningful and useful for my projects.

## Features

- **Routing**: A simple and flexible routing setup to manage navigation between different screens in the app.
- **Theme Management**: A customizable theme structure that allows you to easily manage light and dark themes throughout your app.
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized project folders and files for better scalability as your app grows.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the routing and theme structure to suit your needs. This template is designed as a starting point, and you can expand or modify it based on your project's requirements.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project setup that I find useful for my own workflow. It is not a definitive template for Flutter projects, and I encourage you to adapt it as needed.
